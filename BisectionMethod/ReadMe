BISECTION METHOD

Steps to find the nearest approximate root of the problem

1. consider two roots, one which gives negative result and other gives positive result
    r1 = 2, r2 = 3 
    
    Let our function is defind as below in line 9-10
    bis(x):
      return x**3-2*x-5

2. Find the result for r1 and r2
    f1 = bis(r1) // gives negative result
    f2 = bis(r2) // gives positive result


  3. Create a loop till we find our desired result as from line 18 - 
      for i in range(50):

      4. Display roots
          print("roots : ", r1," , ",r2)

      5. Find the average of previous roots r1 and r2
            a = (r1+r2)/2 // average of roots
            b = bis(a) // result of averaged root
        
        6. Check if result of averaged root is less than zero and greater than previous result f1 as
            if (b<0) and (b>f1):
              r1 = a
      
        7. If result of averaged root is greater than zero and less than f2 as
            if (b>0) and (b<f2):
              r2 = a
        8. if r1 and r2 are equal, then we finally conclude our result as
            if r1==r2:
              print("terminate here")
              break
